# THR_Viewer

# This viewer was created to better visualize .THR (theta rho) files for a circular Sand Art Table.

# THR_Viewer.py will animate a .THR (theta rho) pattern and save a GIF of the pattern animation.
# When run, a dialog box will prompt you to pick a .THR file and then animate it.
# When the graph is closed, it will prompt for another file until cancelled.

# THR_to_GIF_Dir.py prompts for a directory of .THR (theta rho) files to convert to animated GIF.
# Currently somewhat slow to generate, I'm sure this can be optimized much better but functions well enough.
